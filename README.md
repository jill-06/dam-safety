# Dam Safety Monitoring System
## Overview
The Dam Safety Monitoring System is a project designed to simulate a real dam environment using various sensors to monitor critical parameters such as temperature, pressure, and humidity. The system utilizes an ESP8266 microcontroller to collect data from sensors like the DHT11 and logs this data in real-time to a Firebase database. A web-based dashboard has been created to display the sensor data in both a tabular format and visually, providing an easy-to-understand overview of the dam's condition.

## Features
Sensor Integration: Monitors temperature, pressure, and humidity using sensors like DHT11.
ESP8266 Microcontroller: Collects sensor data and sends it to the cloud.
Real-time Data Logging: Utilizes Firebase to log and store data in real-time.
Web Dashboard: Displays data in a user-friendly format with both tables and visual representations.
Future Enhancements: The dashboard can be further enhanced to include more real-time sensor data and additional features.
